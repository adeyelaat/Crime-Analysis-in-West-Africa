WEST AFRICA CRIME ANALYSIS 
 
**Data Visualization & Insights**
This comprehensive dashboard presents a multi-dimensional analysis of crime trends across West African countries, with a special focus on fatalities, weapon usage, perpetrator groups, and regional hot zones. The objective is to support policymakers, researchers, and humanitarian organizations in understanding the evolving landscape of violence across the region.

**Summary Metrics**
Total Fatalities: 6,862
Most Affected Country: Nigeria
Most Affected City: Maiduguri (488 fatalities)
Highest Fatal Year: 2018 (919 fatalities)
Primary Weapon Used: Armed Assault (2,090 incidents)

  **Key Visual Insights**
 Regional Hot Zones
Nigeria dominates both fatalities (12,983) and injuries (29,093), highlighting it as the epicenter of violence in the region.
Chad, Cameroon, and Niger follow with notable numbers, especially in fatalities and injury counts.

**Weapon Analysis**
Armed Assault remains the most utilized weapon type, followed by Bombing/Explosion (1,317), and Armed Assault with minor variants.
Hostage Taking and Unknown categories also contribute significantly, suggesting data granularity and intelligence gaps.

 **Target Types**
Property, Military, and Government entities are the most frequently targeted, suggesting a focus on infrastructure and national stability.
Civilian-heavy sectors such as Education and Religion also face substantial threats.

  **Perpetrator Breakdown**
Boko Haram is the most active and lethal group with 2,629 fatalities attributed.
Fulani extremists and suspected Boko Haram factions also contribute to the regional violence.
A large portion of incidents (1,628) remain unattributed, labeled “Unknown,” pointing to challenges in intelligence and attribution.

  **Trends Over Time**
Fatalities by Year show a dramatic escalation post-2009, peaking around 2014–2018.
The violence timeline aligns with insurgency surges in Nigeria’s northeast and broader instability in the Sahel region.
While there's a slight decline after 2018, overall levels remain significantly higher than pre-2000.

 **City & Country-Level Impact**
Top Cities by Fatalities:
Maiduguri (488)
Kano (130)
Bamenda and Port Harcourt also appear as critical cities with recurring incidents.
Top Countries by Injuries:
Nigeria (5,550)
Cameroon (879)
Niger, Chad, Ghana, and Benin follow with relatively lower impact.

 **10-Year Summary (2011–2020)**
Consistent upward trajectory from 2011 to 2018, with 2018 being the deadliest year.
2015 and 2014 were also high-fatality years, with over 790 deaths each.
Slight decline in 2019 and 2020 suggests potential improvements or underreporting.

  **Strategic Implications**
Security Prioritization: Nigeria should remain the focal point for regional stabilization efforts.
Counterterrorism Focus: Policies and resources must address extremist groups like Boko Haram and Fulani extremists.
Protection of Infrastructure: Safeguarding government, military, and property assets can reduce high-fatality incidents.
Improved Reporting: High number of "Unknown" weapon and perpetrator entries suggests a need for enhanced data collection systems.
